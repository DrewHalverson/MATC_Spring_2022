What screen reader did you use, and what local news station did you pick?
NVDA. NBC15.com

Did you find the national or local website easier to navigate? Why?
I thought they were very similar. I was able to sort out navigation quickly for both sites. 

What surprised you the most about using a screen reader? What was the most challenging aspect for you?
It seemed chaotic. I am used to navigating very quickly without a screen reader and trying to do the same with the 
screen reader made for a lot of jumbled audio / word salad. 

On your website you tested, what do you think could be improved upon in terms of the screen reader experience?
I tested on my blog and I am not sure anything could be improved. It is a minimalist text only installation of Jekyll on GitHub pages and 
the screen reader had no issues navigating it.

What issues did you face that you think would improve with more practice using a screen reader?

There is definitely a learning curve. It seemed very clunky and slow to me but I have a friend with vision impairment who used a screen reader and 
they fly through things as fast as I do with visual navigation.
