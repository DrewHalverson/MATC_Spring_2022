	Three Take Aways:
	
	1. The database design process is critical to building a functional and efficient database. 

	2. Following guidelines for proper database creation makes for a smoother and more functional end product. 
	
	3. As with most things, balance is important. Sometimes things can be over-normalized. Sometimes it makes the 
	most sense to be consistent with a bad naming convention to maintain integrity. 

	
	Three Questions:
	
	1. What's the best way to determine where a balance point is? The section of the article about non-DB folks 	
	viewing normalization as over engineering comes to mind. 

	2. What are best practices for adequate database testing? Is there a percentage of data, a guideline for types of 
	edge cases, etc?

	3. What are best practices for assigning data types? Sometimes it seems pretty arbitrary and ambiguous which 		types need to be assigned.
