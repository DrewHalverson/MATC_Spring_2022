Three Take Aways:

	1. NoSQL platforms are easier to get started with but relational databases work better when you need to understand the data model as a new
	developer. 
	
	2. The choice of which database platform is best depends on how you want to store data, how you plan to access that stored data, and how 
	important performance, durability, accessibility, and consistency are to the project. 

	3. Scalability is not about SQL vs. NoSQL systems, it is about simple vs. complex application queries. 

Three Questions:

	1. At what point is it important to start worrying about scalability? Is it something to be concerned about in any situation?

	2. What does precomputing look like in practice? Whate are some of the technologies used to implement it?
	
	3. How do you determine which is the best option to choosed for ways to scale?
