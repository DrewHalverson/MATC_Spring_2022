Introduction to Databases
Module 3 reflection
Drew Halverson


1) Now that Project 3 is over, what are your first thoughts about it overall? Are they mostly positive or negative?
	I enjoyed working on this project. It implemented everything we learned in module 3 and highlighted how to troubleshoot
	queries when approach to database implementation varies. Positve. 

2) If positive, what comes to mind specifically? Negative?
	I enjoyed working with Vertabelo and seeing how everything came together on completion of the project. I am not a huge fan of phpMyAdmin. 
	It feels clunky and dated. I think it was good to get to work with it because it is so ubiquitous, but I prefer other database management tools. 

3) With regards to the Introduction to Databases course as a whole, what were some of the most challenging moments and what made them so?
	Joins were tricky to sort out. I feel like I could take a whole semester to just understand how they work. My biggest challenge was probably all the 
	work we did with Access at the beginning of the semester. Most of that was conditioned from having to work with it years ago, but I am still not a fan. =]
