1)  With regards to Project 1, would you have been able to complete 
    Project 1 prior to starting this course?

    I think so, with some assistance from Google. I have worked with SQL quite a bit before I started the class and a lot of the concepts were familiar.

2)  Now that you have completed Project 1, what did you find most 
    satisfying about the process or the finished database product?

    Completing the project was satisfying. It was nice to see everything working as it should be. 


3)  Now that you have completed Project 1, what did you find most 
    frustrating about it?

    I don't like Access. Some of that is due to old biases from 
    having had to work with it more than a decade ago, but I am 
    more comfortable working with something like MySQL from a terminal.

4)  Now that you have completed Module 1, what, if anything, would 
    you change about your approach to the weekly classwork as you 
    progress through Modules 2 and 3?

    I am happy with how I approached the course work.
