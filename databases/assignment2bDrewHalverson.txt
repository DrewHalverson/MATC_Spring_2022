Assignment 2b - Drew Halverson

2.23 - Define the terms functional dependency and determinant using an example not from this book.
	
		Functional dependency is a relationship between one attribute and another, such as between a primary key and other attributes in a table (Primary key -> attribute)

		A determinate is an attribute that can be used to determine the value of other attributes. In the table ASSETS(ID, Make, Model, type), ID would be the determinate. 

2.24 - In the following equation, name the functional dependency and identify the determinant(s): Area = Length * Width

		Functional dependency = (Length, Width) -> Area
		The determinate is (Length, Width)

2.25 - Explain the meaning of the following expression: A -> (B, C)
	
		A determines the value of B and C
	
       Given this expression, tell if it is also true that: A -> B and: A -> C

		These are both true

2.26 - Explain the meaning of the following expression: (D, E) -> F

		D and E together determine the value of F

       Given this expression, tell if it is also true that: D -> F and: E -> F
		
		These are both false


2.28 - Define the term primary key in terms of functional dependencies. 

	The primary key is one or more attributes that determine all the rest of the attributes in a relation.
