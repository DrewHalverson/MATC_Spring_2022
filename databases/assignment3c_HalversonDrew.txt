3.38 -  Write an SQL statement to display the last name, first name, and email 
        of any owners of cats.Use a join using JOIN ON syntax. What are the 
        consequences of using (or not using) the DISTINCT keyword in this version 
        of the query?

SELECT OwnerFirstName, OwnerLastName, OwnerEmail FROM PET_OWNER JOIN PET ON 
PET_OWNER.OwnerID = PET.OwnerID WHERE PetType = 'Cat';

The DISTINCT keyword will return unique values if used. If not, duplicates will 
be returned. 


3.46 -  Write an SQL statement to delete all rows of pets of type Anteater. What 
        will happen if you forget to code the WHERE clause in this statement?

DELETE FROM PET_3 WHERE PetBreed = 'Anteater';

Leaving out the WHERE clause will delete all of the rows in the table. 


3.47 -  Write an SQL statement to add a PetWeight column like the one in PET_3 
        to the PET table, given that this column is NULL. Again, assume that 
        PetWeight is Numeric(4,1).

ALTER TABLE PET ADD PetWeight NUMERIC(4,1) NULL;


3.48 -  Write SQL statements to insert data into the PetWeight column you created
        in question 3.47. Use the PetWeight data from PET_3 table as shown in
        Figure 3-28.

INSERT INTO PET (PetWeight)SELECT PetWeight FROM PET_3;
