      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <p>Arte Del Mundo&#174; is a non-profit service that allows
		individual local artists and craftspersons around the
		world to be able to market their products directly to a
		global audience. These fine products are handcrafted
		and are of the highest quality. <em>You avoid the high
		markup costs of retail stores when you purchase directly
		from the artist that produces the goods.</em> Note that this
		website is informational only. All sales are made
		directly via the artists themselves. We're here to
		facilitate and inform.</p>
	  <div>Arte Del Mundo people are in two general categories:
		  <ol>
				<li>First and foremost are the artists themselves, known as Member Artists.</li>
				<li>Secondly, there is a large group of important people, people who like to help Arte Del Mundo
					grow and prosper. These are officially Friends of Arte Del Mundo (more about Friends
					<a href="friendsInfo.html">here</a>). Please consider becoming a Friend.</li>
